# DelphiChatGPT
This is a demo showing how to use Delphi to query ChatGPT and see answers.

ICS is used to query ChatGPT using their API.
You need to generate an API key by using this website: https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys
OpenSSL is used for HTTPS request. That is usual with ICS.
You can get ICS source code using Delphi IDE GetIT package manager or download it from http://wiki.overbyte.be (The download include required OpenSSL for both 32 and 64 bits).
